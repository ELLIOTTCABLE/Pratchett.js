# Reactor
# =======
# This implementation of Paws stores all information about pending evaluation (and thus, information
# about ordering) *in* the data-graph. That is, there isn't an authoritative source, external to the
# object-system, dictating a giant list of ‘instructions to carry out.’ Instead, each `Execution` is
# aware of the (internally-strictly-ordered) `Operation`s pending against it; and meanwhile, each
# `Thing` is aware of any `Liability`s describing the (*externally*-strictly-ordered) `Execution`s
# pending against adoption of that particular `Thing`.
#
# The `Reactor`, however, is the place where that evaluation *actually happens*. So, to avoid each
# `Reactor` instance climbing The Entire Datagraph constantly, the methods that manage the above
# information `::signal` a `Reactor`, so that the `Reactor` can cache a list of “stuff that might
# need to be done”:
#
#  - Whenever a new operation is queued against an `Execution`, a `Reactor` is notified, so that it
#    can watch the `Execution` and eventually actually evaluate it. (The `operational` cache.)
#  - Meanwhile, when the ownership of the datagraph changes, affects which pending `Execution`s
#    might be evaluable; so with every such mutation, `Reactor` is notified that `Liability`s whose
#    subgraphs intersect the graph affected by the mutation need to be re-evaluated. (The
#    `responsibility` cache.)
#
# These two caches are stored separately; because the ‘blocking’ cache supersedes the ‘non-blocking’
# cache: that is, even if there's N pending `Execution`s with operations queued, when a `::signal`
# is received for a change in ownership or responsibility, then the possibly-affected blocked
# `Execution`s “jump the queue” to immediately be evaluated. (This is based on two theories: α, that
# the operation jumping the queue is an `'adopt'`, not an `'advance'`, and thus isn't likely to
# upset a pseudo-intuitive ordering; and β, that if we wait, a *new* interloper could snap up the
# responsibility that just became available ... clearly, something that had already been blocked
# against the ρ in question, should not be made to wait longer for the sake of something that spat
# out an `'adopt'` in the intervening time.)
#
# >  Note: Despite JavaScript being single-threaded (at least with regards to shared memory,
#    anyway); as a proof-of-concept, this implementation allows multiple `Reactor` instances to
#    exist simultaneously; and can be told to pseudo-randomize their ordering: this (badly)
#    simulates a parallel implementation using only *concurrency*; and it should help to surface
#    issues with the locking and concurrency model.
